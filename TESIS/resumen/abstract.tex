 Property Graph databases are being increasingly used within the industry as a powerful and flexible way to model real-world scenarios. With this flexibility, a great challenge appears regarding profiling tasks due to the need of adapting them to these new models while taking advantage of the Property Graphs particularities. This work proposes a set of data profiling tasks by integrating existing methods and techniques, and an taxonomy to classify them. In addition, an application pipeline is provided while a formal specification of some tasks is defined.
