abstract = {The existing methods for graph-based data mining (GBDM) follow the basic approach of applying a single-objective search with a user-defined threshold to discover interesting subgraphs. This obliges the user to deal with simple thresholds and impedes her/him from evaluating the mined subgraphs by defining different ''goodness'' (i.e., multiobjective) criteria regarding the characteristics of the subgraphs. In previous papers, we defined a multiobjective GBDM framework to perform bi-objective graph mining in terms of subgraph support and size maximization. Two different search methods were considered with this aim, a multiobjective beam search and a multiobjective evolutionary programming (MOEP). In this contribution, we extend the latter formulation to a three-objective framework by incorporating another classical graph mining objective, the subgraph diameter. The proposed MOEP method for multiobjective GBDM is tested on five synthetic and real-world datasets and its performance is compared against single and multiobjective subgraph mining approaches based on the classical Subdue technique in GBDM. The results highlight the application of multiobjective subgraph mining allows us to discover more diversified subgraphs in the objective space.},

abstract = {Mining frequent subgraphs is an important operation on graphs; it is defined as finding all subgraphs that appear frequently in a database according to a given frequency threshold. Most existing work assumes a database of many small graphs, but modern applications, such as social networks, citation graphs, or protein-protein interactions in bioinformatics, are modeled as a single large graph. In this paper we present GraMi, a novel framework for frequent subgraph mining in a single large graph. GraMi undertakes a novel approach that only finds the minimal set of instances to satisfy the frequency threshold and avoids the costly enumeration of all instances required by previous approaches. We accompany our approach with a heuristic and optimizations that significantly improve performance. Additionally, we present an extension of GraMi that mines frequent patterns. Compared to subgraphs, patterns offer a more powerful version of matching that captures transitive interactions between graph nodes (like friend of a friend) which are very common in modern applications. Finally, we present CGraMi, a version supporting structural and semantic constraints, and AGraMi, an approximate version producing results with no false positives. Our experiments on real data demonstrate that our framework is up to 2 orders of magnitude faster and discovers more interesting patterns than existing approaches.},

We investigate the fixed-parameter tractability of three fundamental problems related to GFD discovery. We show that the implication and satisfiability problems are fixed-parameter tractable, but the validation problem is co-W[1]-hard in general. We introduce notions of reduced GFDs and their topological support, and formalize the discovery problem for GFDs. We develop algorithms for discovering GFDs and computing their covers. Moreover, we show that GFD discovery is feasible over large-scale graphs, by providing parallel scalable algorithms that guarantee to reduce running time when more processors are used. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithms.},

abstract="The explosion in the amount of the available RDF data has lead to the need to explore, query and understand such data sources. Due to the complex structure of RDF graphs and their heterogeneity, the exploration and understanding tasks are significantly harder than in relational databases, where the schema can serve as a first step toward understanding the structure. Summarization has been applied to RDF data to facilitate these tasks. Its purpose is to extract concise and meaningful information from RDF knowledge bases, representing their content as faithfully as possible. There is no single concept of RDF summary, and not a single but many approaches to build such summaries; each is better suited for some uses, and each presents specific challenges with respect to its construction. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive survey of summarization method for semantic RDF graphs. We propose a taxonomy of existing works in this area, including also some closely related works developed prior to the adoption of RDF in the data management community; we present the concepts at the core of each approach and outline their main technical aspects and implementation. We hope the survey will help readers understand this scientifically rich area and identify the most pertinent summarization method for a variety of usage scenarios.",

abstract="Data quality issues arise in the Semantic Web because data is created by diverse people and/or automated tools. In particular, erroneous triples may occur due to factual errors in the original data source, the acquisition tools employed, misuse of ontologies, or errors in ontology alignment. We propose that the degree to which a triple deviates from similar triples can be an important heuristic for identifying errors. Inspired by functional dependency, which has shown promise in database data quality research, we introduce value-clustered graph functional dependency to detect abnormal data in RDF graphs. To better deal with Semantic Web data, this extends the concept of functional dependency on several aspects. First, there is the issue of scale, since we must consider the whole data schema instead of being restricted to one database relation. Second, it deals with multi-valued properties without explicit value correlations as specified as tuples in databases. Third, it uses clustering to consider classes of values. Focusing on these characteristics, we propose a number of heuristics and algorithms to efficiently discover the extended dependencies and use them to detect abnormal data. Experiments have shown that the system is efficient on multiple data sets and also detects many quality problems in real world data .",
